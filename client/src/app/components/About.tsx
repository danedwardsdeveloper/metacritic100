						MetaCritic 100 is an engaging hobby project that allows film
						enthusiasts to track their viewing progress through the
						top-rated films on Metacritic. This fun, unofficial site is
						not affiliated with Metacritic but instead uses their ratings
						as a foundation for a personal movie-watching challenge. It
						offers users a playful way to explore and track their journey
						through critically acclaimed cinema, turning the pursuit of
						watching top-rated films into an enjoyable, goal-oriented
						experience.
					</p>

					<p className="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-600">
						Metacritic is a renowned review aggregator that compiles
						critic reviews for various media, including films, TV shows,
						music, and video games. For movies, Metacritic calculates a
						weighted average of critic scores, resulting in a "Metascore"
						ranging from 0 to 100. This score provides a quick snapshot of
						critical consensus, with higher scores indicating more
						favorable reviews.
					</p>

					<p className="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-600">
						MetaCritic 100 takes inspiration from this system, focusing
						specifically on the highest-rated films. While not officially
						connected to Metacritic, this project showcases a unique
						intersection of technology and cinema appreciation. It
						combines web development skills with a passion for film,
						creating a platform where movie buffs can challenge themselves
						to watch and keep track of some of the most critically
						acclaimed films of all time.
